# Resources on how to research

##### an idiosyncratic take by Anand D. Sarwate

These are some notes and miscellaneous items about skills and tips for success in research (and beyond!). It is (a) not comprehensive and (b) very idiosyncratic. It will hopefully get more organized and filled in over time. Rather than a monolithic document, things will be split up into subfiles for easier consumption.

This is very much a work in progress and some stuff has yet to be written. If you have some suggestions, please [email me](mailto:anand.sarwate@rutgers.edu).

Some other resources to read:

* Raul Pacheco has some really nice [advice on all sorts of things](http://www.raulpacheco.org/resources/).
* [MIT Comm Lab's CommKit](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/eecs/use-the-commkit/) is a great source for all sorts of things about communication (papers, posters, cover letters etc.).
* [Advice from Nick Feamster and Alex Gray](https://greatresearch.org/2013/08/14/managing-your-advisor/) on "managing your advisor." THey make some good points (I may not agree 100% but ok).

## Getting started

* [Building a research diet](ResearchInputs.md): how to expand your horizons and dig deeper

## Managing your progress

* [Organizing your research](OrganizingWork.md): how to track and maintain progress. Here are two forms for pre-meeting and post-meetings to help keep research progress on track.
   * [Pre-meeting form](PreMtgForm.md)
   * [Post-meeting form](PostMtgForm.md)
* [Developing skills over time](DevelopingSkills.md):  how to check your progress and get help over time.
