# Resources on how to research

This is a pretty unorganized set of documents on various aspects of doing research on topics related to information theory, statistics, machine learning, etc. It will hopefully get more organized and filled in over time. Rather than a monolihic document, things will be split up into subfiles for easier consumption.

## Some links in lieu of more useful stuff

Here are two forms for pre-meeting and post-meetings to help keep research progress on track.

* [Pre-meeting form](PreMtgForm.md)
* [Post-meeting form](PostMtgForm.md)
