# Mentoring Resources and Exercises

This is a set of mentoring resources for mentoring junior faculty, adapted from various sources and programs by [Anand Sarwate](mailto:anand.sarwate@rutgers.edu).

## Starting out

This section is about diagnosing the major issues and setting some concrete objectives for yourself.
 
* Breaking down issues into different facets
* Figuring out a "mosaic of mentors"
* Identifying the main challenges
* Picking some issues to focus on in the medium and long term
* Setting concrete objectives and deadlines

### Different facets of the job/life

Thr first thing to do is identify different facets for the faculty job. Each acutal issue could involve more than one facet, but these give different perspectives on things. The classic breakdown for work stuff is Teaching, Research, and Service. This is kind of unhelpful at times so a more useful set might be focused on skills and objectives:

* Developing teaching resources
* Organizing and managing classes
* Advising students
* Writing papers/publishing
* Grant proposals/funding
* Service internally
* Service externally
* Administrative overhead
* Work/life balance, commuting, etc.
* Work/travel balance
* Building professional networks
* Managing promotion challenges
* Personal time/hobbies/fulfillment
* Immigration and other legal issues

#### To do: identify your own facets

Add additional items to this list if you think there are other facets or skills that you think are part of the job.

### Mentoring network

In general, you need a *network* of mentors to help you navigate various issues. Different people may be better at providing advice on different topics. Importantly, not all of these have to be formal mentors. You can think of them as resources for different issues. 

#### To do: building a mentoring team

Try to identify 1-4 people (or resources) you already know who can provide help with some of these categories below. Some suggestions of the kind of people to think about are listed. Note that the same person may be able to help with multiple issues.

* Substantive feedback (on proposals, papers, etc.)
  * colleagues at Rutgers
  * colleagues elsewhere
  * professional editors 
* Help navigating bureaucracy at Rutgers
  * departmental colleagues or staff
  * people outside the department
* Accessing new opportunities (for research, teaching, or service)
  * colleagues at Rutgers
  * peers
  * external (senior) mentors
* Professional development/networking
  * people who run workshops (e.g. on teaching)
  * peers and potential collaborators
  * professional society leaders
  * senior/connected professional colleagues
* Emotional support
  * friends
  * family
  * other
* Role models (who you can talk to)
* Accountability/deadlines

**Example:** *For networking and building a reputation in my subfield, my postdoc advisor will be a great resource, since she is in a leadership position in my profesisonal society. My friend from grad school who started a few years before me would be a great person to ask about co-organizing a workshop.*

### Identifying issues

One option is to go through the facets above and do a SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunities, threats) analysis for each item. If you can do that without then feeling overwhelmed and self-judgemental, good for you! But it can be overwhelming. 

Remember, this is an ongoing process: it might be better to treat this as a quick check-in on different facets instead, and dig deeper on only a few of them.

#### To do: diagnosing challenges

Try doing a short diagnosis for each issue in terms of resources and where you want to be:

* What do I have a good handle on?
* What is an issue I know how to improve? 
* What am I most confused/challenged by?

**Example:** *Under "advising students" I might have a good handle on being supportive but I need to be better at giving quick feedback on paper drafts. However, I might not know how to get the students to improve their first drafts/get them to self-edit.*


### Picking priorities

Once you have a list of challenges that you are facing/want to address, you have to choose your battles. It's tempting to pick the most urgent ones but for most issues you have to play a long game. Choosing a mix can help balance the feeling of playing [whac-a-mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole) and training for a marathon.

#### To do: identifying goals

Using these rough numbers, try to answer the following questions for the different facets.  Treat each facet independently. This is different from the previous exercise because you want to translate the issues/challenges into goals.

* By the end of the semester or summer, where do you want to be?
  * I will be...
  * I will have finished...
  * I will feel...
* By one year from now, where do you want to be?
  * I will be...
  * I will have finished...
  * I will feel...
* What am I doing already to achieve these goal?
* What is an obstacle between me and the goal?
* What is something that I know can help overcome the obstacle?

Sometimes it's not so clear how to answer these questions, especially the last one. 

**Example:** *I might say that by the end of the summer I want to submit a grant proposal. I have already carved out time in my schedule but I have a lot of conference travel this summer which will make it hard to give concerted effort. I don't know what I can do about the travel since I'm already committed to it.*

After you have some objectives, you need to do some triage. To do this, you have to figure out which tasks are more urgent/difficult/time-consuming.

#### To do: choosing main goals

For each item in the "identifying issues" section, rate (e.g. on a 1-3 scale) the things you know how to improve and the things you don't in terms of urgency, difficulty, and duration.

Finally, go through the facets and pick 2-3 to focus on for the medium term and 2-3 to focus on for the longer term.

### Making a plan

Hopefully by this point it is not so overwhelming ("oh no, I'm completely falling behind on everything"). Academia encourages us to feel perpetually behind on everything. You can try to argue yourself out of it or just let it fade into the background. It's not great: the worry or guilt can make it harder to do the things you need/want to do or harm your work/life balance.

Before making a plan for the challenges you want to work on, it helps to try and clear up some space, mentally and temporally.

#### To do: clearing up time

Try to answer the following questions to help you make the time to meet your objectives.

* What is something I am doing now that I can stop doing?
* What is something I did in the past that I can avoid in the future?
* What is something I don't need to worry about as much as before?

**Example:** *To make more time for proposal writing I've tried to decline TPC/review requests as much as possible. Last semester I put in too much work on the search committee so I can try to avoid being put on the search committee next year. I'm teaching the same class in the fall so I won't have to spend as much time on class prep as I did before.*

#### To do: breaking down tasks

For the medium and long term issues you want to focus on, break down the objectives into smaller sub-tasks and try to schedule deadlines for them.

**Example:** *I want to submit two journal papers by the end of the summer. Multitasking is hard so I will work on finishing paper A first since there are more co-authors. My goal is to finish that by end of June and I send it to my external coauthors for edits/revisions. For July I will work primarily on paper B with my student and submit that first week of August. By then I should have comments on paper A and can polish it off and submit that before Labor Day.*
