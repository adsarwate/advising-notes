## Post-Meeting Form

**Name:**

**Date of meeting:**

*Try to answer these questions as soon as you can after having a research meeting. It is designed to help you process the discussion and plan and prioritize your work for the next week. Examples are given in the template so have a sense of what kinds of things to write.*

#### What new things did I learn from this meeting? 

**Example:** (delete and replace with your own)

* Papers on XXX (e.g. "eigenvalues of random matrices") may relate to my problem.
* My simulation results are probably not a bug but instead bad parameter choices.
* There is a conference deadline in October that we can maybe plan for.


#### What are my new goals for this week?

*SMART is common acronym for talking about goals: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.*

**Example:** (delete and replace with your own)

1.  Watch video lectures to get a basic understanding of RMT.

2.  Download and look at references on Matrix Bernstein inequalities
    used for compressed sensing

3.  See if existing results apply to my problem and if not, why not.

4.  Search for a better parameters in the simulation.

5.  Download the paper template for the conference and check due dates.

*Schedule:* 1 = M-Th, 2 = W, 3 = F, 4 = T-W, 5 = M

#### What references/papers should I look at?

*You should be looking at (new) paper(s) every week in order to become an expert. Get in the habit!*

**Example:** (delete and replace with your own)

* There's video lectures by Dumitriu on random matrix theory (RMT) on YouTube and some course notes.
* Do a literature search on matrix concentration for compressed sensing.

### What are the medium-term goals?

*It's always good to keep the bigger picture in mind.*

**Example:** (delete and replace with your own)

* Finish this proof by the end of the month.
* Schedule a qualifying exam for next semester.
* Get a draft/outline of a conference paper in the next two weeks.


### How can I change the way I work?

*Reflecting on what worked/didn't work can help you find **your** best way of working.*

**Example:** (delete and replace with your own)

* Make sure to not work on just one thing all day -- break it up a little.
* Take written notes on papers as I read them instead of just reading them.
* More comments in my code for simulations.


### What was helpful or unhelpful in today's meeting? 

*If you identify how a meeting can be more helpful, we structure future meetings better.*

**Example:** (delete and replace with your own)

* Getting specific words to search for in Google Scholar was nice.
* Reading through my code to debug during the meeting was not a good use of time.
* I felt like I didn't know what was expected of me.
* I lose my train of thought when I'm interrupted mid-sentence. I would like to finish what I am saying before processing questions.

### Additional comments

**Example:** (delete and replace with your own)

* It would help to end 5 minutes early so I have time to go to my class.
