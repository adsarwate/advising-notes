## Peer reviewing

What's the point of peer review? Arguably, it is one of the mechanisms for research to self-regulate. Detractors might say that it is a way to enforce conformity and suppress new ideas.

A couple of points at the start:

* When you submit a paper you create "review debt" in the sense that people will spend time reviewing your work so you are obligated to spend some time reviewing the work of others.
* You may not think of yourself as an expert. But you do know more than 99% of the rest of the world.

Reviewing is one of the many ways to read a paper. Both conference and journal papers get reviews, and the depth of the reviews that you get and that you write may vary. Ideally a review provides detailed and constructive feedback to the authors.

There are tons of guides to writing revews out there (from various publishers) so rather than rehash those, I'll focus on some dos and don'ts. A good starting point is this paper: 

* Graham Cormode, [How NOT to review a paper: the tools and techniques of the adversarial reviewer](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1519103.1519122), ACM SIGMOD Record 37(4), 2009. 

This is an entertaining read focused on computer science reviewing but I think gets the point across pretty well. 

It's common to complain about reviewers not understanding your paper or that they wrote a very short and not-useful review. Your goal should be to write a review that people won't complain about.

* One of the most time consuming aspects of a review is checking for "correctness": making sure the claims and proofs are clearly written and true. If you find a bug in a proof, you should explain what the error is. If you can't follow the proof the issue might be with your own understanding or it could be that the writing isn't clear. If you think it's the latter, you have to articulate *why* it's not clear.
* It's hard to assess the "significance" of a result. You might think that they are asking the wrong question. They might be! There is a quote from Gian-Carlo Rota, a mathematicican, that a paper "filled a much-needed hole in the literature."
* "Novelty" is another hard thing to measure. What makes a result novel? It might be the setup of the problem, the solution, the proof technique, or something else. Just because something hasn't been done before doesn't make it "novel" but also simply saying "it's not novel" is a useless statement in a review.
* Reviewers often confuse novelty with "surprisingness". "But this result is not surprising to me," they say. Of course it's always nice to read a paper which has a surprising result: you get a little thrill! 
* One of the stupidest ways to reject a paper is to say that the arguments were *too simple* or *trivial*. The hard part about research is asking the right question. If the author(s) ask the question in the right way (and differently from how people have done it before) and the solution turns out to be simple, this is a cause for celebration!
* On the other hand, sometimes people make so many simplifying assumptions that the solution does become trivial (and uninteresting). In this case the problem is with the *assumptions* or model of the problem, not with the solution.
* Sometimes you might wish that the authors had written a different paper. Your job is to review the paper that is there, however. If you have concrete suggestions on future directions, let them know, but in the end you have to judge the paper that is there.
