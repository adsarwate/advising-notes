## Peer reviewing

What's the point of peer review? Arguably, it is one of the mechanisms for research to self-regulate. Detractors might say that it is a way to enforce conformity and suppress new ideas.

When you submit a paper you create "review debt" to the research community in the sense that people will spend time reviewing your work so you are obligated to spend some time reviewing the work of others. Since more papers are submitted than accepted, this is not like formal accounting but more that you are expected to be a good "citizen of the research community."

### Deciding whether to review

Suppose you have been contacted by a conference or journal and asked to review a paper. The paper is on applying ideas/tools from some field A to problem B with applications to C. Should you review it?

* **Is this request legit?** The first thing is to make sure you know/have heard of/can verify the reputation of the venue asking you to review. You might want to also look up the person asking you for the review: are they a researcher in this field and are they at a real institution? There are lots of scam conferences/journals out there.

* **Is this a topic I work on?**  You may not think of yourself as an expert because you are not working on the exact problem the paper is working on. But you can't be so narrow: chances are you do know quite a bit about the general area. You might work on C but are not so familiar with A and B. You might be working on B and have never heard of A. One way to assess fit is to ask yourself "based on the title and abstract, would I maybe read this paper?"

* **Do I have time to do a good job in time?** It is very tempting to say "yes" whenever someone asks. This can lead to overcommitting and then you end up doing a half-job on the review and/or being super late in submitting it. If you would need more time, ask for it up front or decline.

Most importantly: **respond quickly, especially if the answer is no.** The worst thing as an editor is to send a review request and hear back "no" two weeks later. That wasted a whole two weeks! Now multiply that by 3. If you can't do it, say you can't do it ASAP.


### Doing the review

Reviewing is one of the many ways to read a paper. Both conference and journal papers get reviews, and the depth of the reviews that you get and that you write may vary. Ideally a review provides detailed and constructive feedback to the authors.

Even as an expert, there will be things in the paper you are reviewing which are not obvious to you, totally new to you, or are subtly wrong in a way that is hard to detect. This is why it takes some time to write a thorough review.

There are tons of guides to writing revews out there (from various publishers) so rather than rehash those, I'll focus on some dos and don'ts. A good starting point is this paper: 

* Graham Cormode, [How NOT to review a paper: the tools and techniques of the adversarial reviewer](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1519103.1519122), ACM SIGMOD Record 37(4), 2009. 

This is an entertaining read focused on computer science reviewing but I think gets the point across pretty well. 

It's common to complain about reviewers not understanding your paper or that they wrote a very short and not-useful review. Your goal should be to write a review that people won't complain about.

* One of the most time consuming aspects of a review is checking for "correctness": making sure the claims and proofs are clearly written and true. If you find a bug in a proof, you should explain what the error is. If you can't follow the proof the issue might be with your own understanding or it could be that the writing isn't clear. If you think it's the latter, you have to articulate *why* it's not clear.
* Don't lean too hard on saying a result is "not that significant" because it's a pretty lazy critique. It's hard to assess the "significance" of a result. You should think about what kind of result would be "significant" and then ask if it's reasonable to expect that kind of result. 
* "Novelty" is another hard thing to measure. What makes a result novel? It might be the setup of the problem, the solution, the proof technique, or something else. Just because something hasn't been done before doesn't make it "novel" but also simply saying "it's not novel" is a useless statement in a review.
* Reviewers often confuse novelty with "surprisingness". "But this result is not surprising to me," they say. Of course it's always nice to read a paper which has a surprising result: you get a little thrill! But results need not be suprising to be interesting/useful/transformative.
* One of the stupidest ways to reject a paper is to say that the arguments were *too simple* or *trivial*. The hard part about research is asking the right question. If the author(s) ask the question in the right way (and differently from how people have done it before) and the solution turns out to be simple, this is a cause for celebration!
* On the other hand, sometimes people make so many simplifying assumptions that the solution is obvious, uninteresting, and not useful. In this case the problem is with the *assumptions* or model of the problem, not with the solution.
* Sometimes you might wish that the authors had written a different paper. Your job is to review the paper that is there, however. If you have concrete suggestions on future directions, let them know, but in the end you have to judge the paper that is there. You might think that they are asking the wrong question. They might be! There is a quote from Gian-Carlo Rota, a mathematician, that a paper "filled a much-needed hole in the literature." You can use zingers like that only if you are as famous as Rota.
