# Becoming a graduate researcher

##### an idiosyncratic take by Anand D. Sarwate

These are some notes and miscellaneous items about skills and tips for success in graduate school (and beyond!). It is (a) not comprehensive and (b) very idiosyncratic. Things I'm not going to talk about:

* what classes to take
* how to pass various exams

This is very much a work in progress and some stuff has yet to be written. If you have some suggestions, please email me.

## Getting started: look like a researcher, not an undergrad

Since your goal is to publish new research discoveries, you have to start thinking of yourself as having a "public image" as a researcher. This means you have to create a way for other researchers (or potential employers) to find you and learn more about what you are working on. The last thing you want is for people to search for your name and turn up nothing or worse, a bunch of links to different people with the same name with embarassing social media presences.

A checklist:

* Create a homepage
* Make git repo
* Consider your social media presence
* Update your profile on LinkedIn
* Create an ORCID

You can do all of these in a day (or even half a day). There is really no excuse to not doing this **immediately**.

### Create a homepage

You should create a homepage for yourself. Why? That way you have a place to put your CV, links to projects and code, a description of your research, and other public-facing information about yourself. You don't have to list hobbies or the books you read or anything else that you don't feel like sharing. But having a homepage gives people wanting to know more about your research someplace to go. It is also important for internships -- companies will look at your website to see what you are doing. You don't have to have any publications yet!

You have a couple of options:

* host the website on a department or university server - you can hardcode the HTML (not advised, but this is what I have now due to legacy code) or use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) or [jemdoc](https://jemdoc.jaboc.net)
* make a site on Google Sites
* host a site on github.io (needs a github account)

### Make a github (or other) account

It is very important to have a public repository of code from projects you have worked on. Perhaps you already have a git account on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) or [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com/): good for you! 

We have a [lab site on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/sarwate_lab). You should ask for access if you haven't already. There are lots of reasons to have a repo:

* If you write code for an algorithm you developed or a simulation from a paper, you should create a repo for the paper and post the code (including preprocessing) and data (or a link to the data if it's a public data set). This is part of doing reproducible research. The code should be hosted on the lab site, probably but you can link to it from your own site.
* If you apply for an internship, companies will look at your git repos. If you have nothing there, they will think you have no skills: it looks bad! If you have no papers yet but some code from class projects, put up the code and project there. This shows that you know how to do things.
* If you get a job in industry, chances are you will have to use git. You should be aware of how it works and how to use it in order to be more employable.
* You can use the lab git repository and point to contribuutions you have made to research projects (e.g. the code from a paper) there.

Make sure you link to your git account from your homepage!
 
### Social media

Social media is currently a totally optional thing -- lots of prominent researchers do not have Twitter accounts. However, if it is something you are comfortable with, you might consider creating a Twitter account to engage with other members of the academic community (and the public more broadly). The downsides are standard: social media can be a total waste of time and attention. Also looking at other people promoting their own research can make you feel bad about yourself/your own progress. The upsides are that you might get a better sense of what kind of research is interesting to people/generates a lot of attention.

If you already have a Twitter handle, keep in mind that people who read your papers will automatically connect your Twitter handle with your role as a researcher. This is a hazard depending on what you do publicly on twitter.

Full disclosure: I am trying to use Twitter less.

### Update LinkedIn

Even if it's not clear how much it helps you, it doesn't really hurt you to have a profile up. Employers will look you up on LinkedIn, including people looking for potential interns. This is especially true of managerial level folks who are less interested in poking through your github. Create a profile there and make sure the information is current (including the homepage you just made).

A great resource for understanding job-related things, how to present yourself in interviews, and so on, is the [Ask a Manager](https://www.askamanager.org/) blog.

### Create an ORCID

Many publication venues are now requring authors to link their papers with their ORCID. You can create one at [https://www.orcid.org/](https://www.orcid.org/).

### Make a CV

You will want to make a resume or CV (see the [MIT Comm Lab's CommKit]
(https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/nse/use-the-commkit/)) that you can update as you progress through grad school. A CV is more research-oriented, whereas a resume is more for looking for jobs/internships. Depending on the internship, they may prefer a CV. Sometimes you feel awkward making a CV before you have published anything, but having one there that you can add to is important.

There are many CV templates on Overleaf so you can choose one which looks good to you.

### Sign up for seminars and mailing lists

You should plan to go to lots of talks! At first, the talks will be confusing because you don't know as much about research. But later on you will start to understand more and more. There are many benefits of going to talks on topics that are not **only about your research**:

* Being aware of what other work is out there is part of general scientific literacy: if you go to an interview and have only learned about some tiny narrow thing, the interviewer will think that you are too specialized and can't learn new things.
* The greatest asset to a researcher is curiousity. If something about a talk sounds interesting, then go to it! You will always learn something and any day you learn something new is a good day.
* Ideas from other fields can help you with your problem: maybe there are connections you didn't know existed, or a whole area of research which is interesting and related to what you are working on.

At Rutgers, here are some seminars of interest:

* [SIP Seminar](http://www.inspirelab.us/seminars/): email [ECE_SIP-request@email.rutgers.edu](mailto:ECE_SIP-request@email.rutgers.edu) with SUBSCRIBE to sign up for announcements.
* [Statistics Seminar](https://statistics.rutgers.edu/news-events/seminars): use the [signup form](https://lists.sas.rutgers.edu/mailman/listinfo/stat-seminar).
* [MSIS Seminar](https://msis-rutgers.net/seminar/): email [Prof. Jalaj Upadhyay](mailto:jalaj.upadhyay@rutgers.edu) to subscribe.
* [CS Theory Seminar](https://theory.cs.rutgers.edu/theory_seminar): there is a calendar feed/link you can add to your calendar.
* [DIMACS Weekly Announcements](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/events/list): email [Linda Casals](mailto:lindac@dimacs.rutgers.edu) to get on the weekly announcement list.

## Getting organized

### Resources

Here are forms that you can fill out before and after research meetings with your advisor. 

* [Pre-meeting form](https://www.overleaf.com/read/xkvnfjpbptkg)
* [Post-meeting form](https://www.overleaf.com/read/htcxqtdxrbgm)

I think that filling out the post-meeting form the **same day as a meeting** can help you get planning for the week ahead (maybe you change it a little as you go). Sending the pre-meeting form **the day before your meeting** helps use the meeting time to focus on what you want to discuss.

Overall, the goal is to develop self-reflection processes which help you check in with how you are doing/working. It may take a little longer to write these the first few times you do it but it will become faster and easier once you get the hang of it. Ultimately, the most transferrable skill you get from doing a graduate thesis (MS or PhD) is the ability self-organize to finish a big project.

One by-product of using these forms is a better sense of how you spend your time. This is **not** about needing to spend more time working or in lab, but about how you use your time. You can start to see patterns (good and bad) in how you work: maybe trying to read new papers in the morning works best for you, or you have to budget more time for writing code because you’re not very fast at it. You can see what works and doesn’t work for you and make adjustments. 

### Keeping track of your work

What will not work very well is for you to think that you will just keep track of everything in your head. Give up that idea now. Likewise, having 500 Notability PDFs with each day's notes will be hard to keep track of.

I recommend having a notebook, either physical (yes, I'm old) or a LaTeX document where you can keep notes on your progress. Things you might consder:

* A "diary" style where you write for each day the notes and can track what your current main tasks/objectives are and then document what you have done to reach those.

* A project-based file where you have more detailed notes on a single project which you can rearrange as you go along. For example, you might structure it like a paper, putting maybe some stuff in a "related work" section, having a problem formulation section where you fix the notation and define the problem, and a "useful tools" section where you can put little lemmas, probability facts, concentration inequalities, etc. for easy access -- copying over from a paper you are reading can actually be helpful in undestanding -- as you rewrite their lemma using your notation you get a better sense of how to apply it.

There are also tons of to-do list management tools out there and productivty philosophies if you want to read about those. Some combination of that advice might work for you.



### Time management

Time management is a crucial skill!

* [http://www.raulpacheco.org/tag/project-planning/](http://www.raulpacheco.org/tag/project-planning/)

Grad school is tricky: you are a student but you are also an employee. You might have a family. Work-life balance is very important, so try to make sure you are keeping that balance in mind and don't ignore things like diet, exercise, sleep, and fun/relaxation. For some people different times of day may be better for different types of work: writing is a lot easier in the morning for me. For some people having a regular schedule is important: one friend in grad school maintained a strict 8 AM - 4 PM schedule, while another liked to come in late, take a long break in the middle of the day to work out at the gym, and then stayed in lab until 9 or 10 PM. Find what works for you.

It's very easy to lose track of time! One thing that can be helpful is to spend a week where you log your time (maybe even in 15 minute intervals). In the US, lawyers charge for their time in 6 minute increments, but that seems too fine-grained. This type of self montioring once might help you identify where you are spending your time. Maybe you will see a pattern or habit you want to change or you can think of a way to organize your time differently.

There is more to write here but remember: any day in which you learn something new is a useful day. So try to make that the minimum target for each day. Learning new things is what research is all about!



### Balancing coursework, teaching, and research

This is tricky! Having clearly stated objectives and blocking off time for reseearch is critical. So when you sit down to do some research you can do something useful with that time. For example, your immediate task may be to read a paper and take notes, or to look up references for something, or to write some code.

If you are a TA then beiing a TA is your job so you have to do a good job at it. That doesn't mean spending 30 hours per week on it -- the contract says you only have to work N hours per week (on average) so if you find yourself doing a lot more there is probably a problem that needs to get addressed.

If you are taking classes then you should try to learn as much as you can in the classes. But that doesn't mean you should be spending 30 hours per week on a class: if it is too hard maybe it's not the right class, or if you are spending that much time maybe there is a more effective/efficient strategy. Just try to be mindful of how much time you are spending.

### Preparing for meetings

Here is a set of questions to ask yourself before going into your weekly research meeting. It can help you clarify your objectives and what you want to get out of the meeting. These are also captured in the pre-meeting form.

* What were your main goals during this period?
  * Be specific, e.g. 
  * 1. Read paper X to understand Y, 
  * 2. Find data sets and be able to load them in Python, 
  * 3. write up the proof we discussed on the board
* What did you do to achieve these goals?
  * Use your notebook to help with this! For example:
  * On Monday and Tuesday I read Lemmas 1-4 but didn't look at Y.
  * Wednesday I had to work on a project for a class, but I downloaded the data sets
  * Thursday I started writing up the proof but I got stuck. 
  * On Friday and Saturday I was busy with family obligations because of a holiday.
  * Sunday I loaded the dataset but there is some bug which I can't figure out yet.
* Did you find something interesting or new?
* If you got stuck, where did you get stuck?
  * It's not enough to say "I'm stuck" -- you want to know why.
  * Have some specific questions.
  * Say what you tried to do that didn't work.
  * The reasons for being stuck aren't always technical: maybe you are using the wrong search term, maybe you don't know where find the piece of math you need, or maybe you need to fix something with time management.
* What approaches do you think might work?
  * Identify possible sources of a solution -- better search terms, the right field of math or a introductory textbook, or getting a better sleep schedule.

**After the meeting** you should also make some notes for yourself that will help you organize the next week.

* What new things did I learn from this meeting?
* What references/papers should I look at?
* Are there directions that look more or less promising?
* Are there short-term ways in which I should change how I work?
* Are there long-term ways in which I should change how I work?
* What are my new goals for this week?


## Research Skills

There are a lot of different concrete skills that you (should) develop as a graduate student. A lot of these have to do with successfully grappling with the vast amount of research that already exists: how to read it, how to evalute it critically, how to organize and summarize it, and how to present it.

### How to read a paper

There is already lots of advice on how to read papers out there. I think the first thing to decide is what kind of reading are you going to do? That is, you have to figure out what you want to learn from the paper.

* What is this area of research about?  Then you can read the introduction, conclusion, and skim the rest perhaps.
* How do they formulate their problem mathematically? You should read the intro (maybe skim some of it/read it later) and definitely read the model, problem statement, or whatever that section is called.
* What does this paper show? Read all of the above as well as the main results (but not the proofs). Focus on trying to understand what the results mean.
* How do they prove their results? In this case you want to focus on the proofs at least at the proof sketch level or even better, line by line. Try to make sure you can understand each step, or ask for help!

Always read with an objective in mind:

* *I want to learn something new.* Read and take a few notes so you remember!
* *I want to come up with a better formulation of my problem.* Try and translate that paper's notation into your own notation.
* *I need a tool to help my proof.* Copy out the lemma or theorem. Where can it apply in your problem? Does your problem satisfy all the conditions?
* *I want to see what experiments to run.* Find out where to get the data sets. Does the paper have a code repo? Are there already preprocessing scripts out there?
* *I need to find more references on this topic.* Look at the related work. Maybe you are doing a literature search (see below).

### How to do a literature search

Doing a literature search means finding all of the relevant papers on a single topic. The goal is to broad and comprehensive -- you want to find more papers/books/etc. that might be useful before you decide which ones to include in your search.

One way to start is to pick a paper that you know is on the topic and read the intro/related work section. There will be sentences like "Patel et al. [13] showed that the general problem of optimizing the rate is NP-hard, but later work by Xu and Zhang [14] gave a characterization of problems which can be efficiently optimized by solving a linear program." Then you know that the papers by Patel et al. [13] and Xu and Zhang [14] aer both relevant to the theoretical aspects of the problem. You can download those to papers and late read their related work, etc.

Another good option is to see what papers cite the paper you found by looking in Google Scholar for example. Then you can find later papers which cite the paper you are looking at. Some will seem relevant and some will be irrelevant. Download the relevant ones and do the same search procedure on them by reading the related work.

How do you decide whether to include a paper in your search? You want to search broadly but you need to categorize the papers so that you can start organizing the citations by what the papers talk about. You might have one category of primarily experimental papers, one category for theoretical analyses, one category for applications to diffent problems, and so on. Or you might have papers which are written by statisticians versus those written by electrical engineers which don't seem to cite each other but are looking at similar problems.

Some questions to help you organize your thinking around a paper you are looking at are given below. These are not exhaustive but should give you a sense of the kind of questions you should be asking before and as you read.

* Where was this published? Is this a top-tier journal or conference? Is it one you have heard of? It's easy to find papers which are published in less impactful venues which might seem to be relevant but which are actually not.
* Who are the authors and what institution (academic or industry) are they from? What kind of department are they in? This can tell you a lot about the methodology and terminology you are likely to encounter in the paper.
* What sort of paper is this: one which proposes a new model and proves new theorems, one which solves a longstanding open problem, one which proposes algorithms an analyses them, one which proposes algorithms and shows that they work experimentally, one which summarizes the work in an area, or some mix of the above?
* What kind of analytical tools do they use?
* What is the scale of the experiments: testing it out on commonly used datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10, or application-specific data sets which are publicly available, or data which is only available to the authors?

It is quite possible to have 100+ papers that you download. That is research! You have to SEARCH and REad to understand what has been done before.


### How to write a literature review

Once you have your pile of papers and notes on the papers, you have to organize them into a coherent description of the related work on a problem.

Finally, take notes on each of the papers, and add the references to a BibTeX file so you can write up a summary. Start by writing little chunks of summary tying things togeher. For example: 

> *"the problem was first studied by Johnson [1] and sparked new work in both the physics and engineeing communities. Physicists [2-4] used statistical mechanics to understand the phenomena in very large systems. The recent survey paper by Gentile et al. [5] describes this body of research in great detail. On the engineering side, separate work by Horn and Kay [6] and Sastry et al. [7] showed that for smaller systems one could observe coupling between individual components..."* 

Then you might have a separate section which addresses experimental or algorithmics work. And so on.

Eventually you have enough fragments to try and organize them into a story. Think of how you would explain the problem to your friend and all the work that has been done. You can't do it by talking about random papers, but instead talk about different dimensions of the problem and what work has been done in those directions.

If this literature review is part of a related work section for a  paper you are wriing, then you need to describe what the paper does, what it doesn't do, and what your paper does differently. You should never (if you can avoid it) write a sentence like 

> *Patel et al. studied a similar problem [1]*. 

In what way is it similar? That sentence is almost meaningless.

### How to review a paper

Chances are, once you have gotten a reasonable handle on research in an area, you might be asked to review a paper.

There is already lots of advice on how to write reviews:

## Software and tools

In addition to having a homepage and a git repo, there are a number of other pieces of software which are important to learn how to use.

### Bibliography management

You should end up reading a **lot** of papers in grad school. You need to figure out how to organize them! There are quite a few tools out there:

* [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) helps manage papers and references (like iTunes for your research papers). It's ope-source There are browser plugins that let you grab the PDF and citation information from the website of a paper.
* Many BibTeX or BibLaTeX managers (e.g. BibDesk on Mac OS) have a "notes" feature or something where you can type in some quick notes associated to the bib entry.

If you read a paper and find it remotely interesting or helpful, get the bibliography entry for it. **NOTE:** Zotero, if you use it, will generate .bib files for use with LaTeX. Chances are that they will not be formatted properly and your bibliography will look messy when compile. So you need to manually fix those .bib entries.

There are many issues that come up in bibliographies: John Owens [has a whole webpage of them](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/biberrors.html).

It helps to have some sort of "diary" or other way of keeping a log of what you've been reading and what the main points of the paper were, things that were interesting or confusing, and things that you might want to follow up on. For the last thing, it could be some problem the paper left unanswered (maybe you can answer it) or some new analysis/technique you might want to learn, or just that you need to cite this paper when working on this problem.

### Programming

If you are an EE student, chances are you have done a lot of your programming in MATLAB. While lots of places still use MATLAB, you are better off learning Python, and particular using `numpy` and `scipy` for simulations.  Most people I know use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) with Spyder. If you are doing large-scale nachine learning (e.g. deep learning) you might want to learn how to use [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax). Download [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) so you can make interactive Python `.ipython` notebooks -- this is a good way to keep track of code and notes, since the notebooks support LaTeX markup. If you install python using 

Another language you can learn (especially if you think you might be engaging seriously with the statistics literature) is `R`. The syntax is very similar to MATLAB (and in particular matrix multiplication, which is ugly in Python, is more MATLAB-like in `R`). There is a very active open-source development base for `R` and many statistics papers come with an `R` package that you can install and use to test/apply the methods.

Knowing Python, `R`, and MATLAB are a good start, but if you want to do more serious software development, learning C# or C++ or another "real" (compiled) language is not a bad idea.

Why am I so anti-MATLAB? It's expensive, not that fast, and industry is moving away from it. Switching to Python is not hard, once you overcome the psychological barrier of having to learn another language.


## Computational Experiments

A lot of experiments in my research areas involve working with simulations of algorithms operating on synthetic or real data. This means that there are often many different ways of understanding how to set up an appropriate experimental validation of your theoretical or algorithmic ideas. What follows is one approach to figuring out how to set up and run your experiments. In this, I assume you have the algorithm working properly (i.e. the bugs have been worked out).

The central thing to figure out is the set of questions your want your experiments to answer. These questions have to be specific and answerable in a single plot/table/diagram/etc. It is tempting to run a bunch of simulations first and then figure out what questions to ask later but you will invariably end up asking different questions than you should or having to rerun of new simulations. 

So what do I mean by specific and answerable? Let's do an example of refining a too-general question into something more workable. Suppose you have an algorithm for training a predictor on labeled data (a supervised learning algorithm). The algorithm has parameters A and B. Starting from the top:

* How good is my algorithm?
* How does the test error of my algorithm behave?
* What is the test error of my algorithm as a function of the sample size?
* How does the test error decrease with the number of training points?
* How does the test error decrease with the number of training points for small A?
* How does changing B affect how my test error decreases with the number of training points when A is small?

At the end you can answer this question with a plot that has several plots (one for each value of B) of error versus training set size for fixed A.

When figuring out what to do for experiments you want to write down the list of performance criteria (e.g. test error, run time, memory usage, bandwidth) and a list of algorithm parameters (A, B, sample size, bound on the norm of input points, etc.). You will be fixing some of these and seeing how the others behave. Or you will be constraining one of the performance criteria (e.g. make sure the memory doesn't exceed 1 Gb).

When preparing to do experiments:

* Make a list of questions first. **Write them down.**
* Figure out what simulations to run.
* Determine how to visualize your results.
* Interpret your results (e.g. answer the question).




## Writing tips

General writing advice:

* Writing is hard! It is 99% rewriting. Be prepared for writing to take lots of time: more time than you think it should.
* Read Harold Becker's Writing for Social Scientists (in the lab Google Drive or you can find it online). It says "for social scientists" but has a lot of general advice which can help when you are writing.
* [Improving your academic writing: My top 10 tips](http://www.raulpacheco.org/2013/02/improving-your-academic-writing-my-top-10-tips/)
* Get used to writing notes and other mini writeups in LaTeX. This will both help you get more proficient with LaTeX but also the act of writing down can help in trying to understand things. For example, suppose you want to use a theorem from some paper or book. Copy out the theorem and 


### Getting started with writing

One of the hardest things about writing is getting started. Staring at a blank page can be quite intimidating. But there are a couple of ways to get started (see also the advice from the Becker book).

* Mind maps: a mind map is a graph where you can write down little ideas/concepts and link them to help you organize your thoughts. There are lots of explanations online.
* Outlining: making a detailed outline of your paper/writeup is a good starting place. You can go all the way down to outlining paragraph-by-paragraph if necessary. What an outline can do is break the writing task into more manageable pieces. Depending on what you are writing, there are outlines to start with, such as:
  * Introduction
  * Model/Problem Statement
  * Proposed Algorithm
  * Analysis
  * Experiments
  * Discussion/Conclusion
* If you are writing up a proof or some analysis, you can also outline just that part so you can break down the steps of the argument that you need to make, like
  * Decomposing the error
  * Bounding $\beta_1$
  * Bounding $\beta_2$
  * Formulating the error as a recursion
  * Putting all the pieces together
* Avoiding censoring: sometimes when writing it is best to start by just putting any text on the page and then later going back to edit it. Becker has some advice on this as well. This works especially if you have a lot of ideas but are not sure how to organize them. Writing down all your thoughts (even if in half sentences and non-grammatical) puts it all down on paper and lets you go back and organize it.
* Being verbose: start out by writing lots of explanation of what you uare doing and why. For example: "Now what we need to do is upper bound $\beta^2(x)$ by a constant that does not depend on $x$. There are two ways to do this: one by analyzing the recursion in \eqref{eq:recursion} and the other by doing a Taylor series expansion. Let's try the second approach first." That way when you go back to those notes later you will remember what you were thinking at the time. 



### Editing and rewriting

There is a ton of advice out there on editing and writing. Here are a few references which I think are extremely helpful:

* [Common errors](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/etc/writing-bugs.html)
* Howard S. Becker, Writing for Social Scientists, University of Chicago Press, 2007.  
You may think that this is not a book engineers need to read but it has lots of great advice about the writing process, especially in the first few chapters.

For some very specific advice (big and small) regarding mathematical writing, see the tips section of [this overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hczfttksjhqs)


#### Starting out

When you sit down to formally write up your results into something that looks like a paper, it's time to get a bit more organized and systematic. You might be starting from some other informal writeup in LaTeX, or just handwritten notes, or just little snippets and fragments from an email thread. Regardless of what you have so far, *make a fresh document*. 

I learned many of the rules of mathematical writing from this handout from when I was an undergradute:

* [Writing a Math Phase Two Paper](http://web.mit.edu/18.704/www/piiUJM2.pdf). There is an HTML [(older version)](http://web.mit.edu/mathp2/www/piil.html)

Mathematical writing is its own skill and it not the same writing that you would do on a homework or exam. This is often the hardest thing for graduate students to learn. It takes *practice*.

If you plan to submit to a conference, **use the template** from the conference website. Templates change over time, sometimes in small ways, and the last thing you want is to have the server reject your PDF for some formatting violation caused by you using the previous year's template (this has happened to me). Using the template also prevents some of the weird LaTeX compilation errors.

Finally, remember that when you sit down to write, you're going to be doing a lot of editing and rewriting afterwards. Resist the urge to try and apply constraints or formatting hacks: save it for the editing stage. "Making it fit into the page limits" is something you can work on *after* your ideas are cleanly and clearly written. Don't put any \vspace{-0.5cm} or stuff like that: focus on the *content*.

Focus on getting the ideas you want to say in an order that would make sense to someone who doesn't know the problem you're working on. For example, imagine a classmate of yours from undergrad or grad school. I find outlining helps a lot, and then refining the outline with more and more details until you have manageable chunks that you can actually write.

#### Editing

Once you get the ideas in the right order, the technical material written, and the major issues out of the way, it may come time to "polish" the manuscript. What I call "polishing" is an iterative process to edit and improve the manuscript. 

#### Final checks

When you are going to submit something it helps to go through through the manuscript several times to check one last time for the small issues. Being systematic about this will take less time and catch more bugs. You can do complete checks over the document for each of these things one by one, so a check for typos, for citations, for bibliography, for math formatting, etc. Focusing on one issue per go-through is better so that you don't miss things from context-switching.

* *Citations as nouns*: search for `\cite{}` commands and make sure you're not treating any of them as nouns. See below for more details.
* *Bibliography*: check that the bibliography looks consistent (see rules for bibliographies below) and correct.
* *Spelling and grammar*: read the paper *backwards*, sentence by sentence (or paragraph by paragraph. This helps you focus on each sentence individually to make sure it's correct.
* *Math formatting*: check that equations have autosizing delimiters and are punctuated correctly. Check that there are not extra blank lines before/after equations.


#### Making things fit

You will often end up in the situation where your paper is anywhere from a few paragraphs to several pages over the limit for wherever you are submitting. The question is how do you make it all fit?

Things **not** to do:

* Do not use `\vspace{-1mm}` or any sort of "negative" spacing. This is all manual hacking and should be avoided: let LaTeX do the layout, not you. That's the whole point of logical formatting.

The trick is to go systematically to make things fit. Work from the end of the document forward.

* Move material to the appendix or supplementary material.
* Check if you have too much "navigation" text. Conference papers are short and do not need an "organization of this paper" section. Having text at the end of sections saying what is coming next or text at the start of a section summarizing the section is nice from a reading perspective but is not always necessary. It's easy to go too far in this direction, but often this is filler.
* Edit your sentences to make them simpler. See some of the writing/editing tips and advice for this. There are a lot of "unnecessary words" that we all use when writing. For example, this document you are reading is too wordy and could uuse some editing. Read the writing guides for tips and tricks!
* Move (some) equations in-line. It's easy to go overboard on this! Any time you want to move an equation from display mode to in-line, ask yourself how important that equation is and whether it will help the reader to see it displayed/centered versus in-line.
* Manipulate figures. Shrinking figures is a way to get more space but make sure they are still legible/readable! You might want to make the lines in the plot thicker to be easier to read. Sometimes you might have an illustrative figure which helps the reader figure out what is going on: those are good targets for moving to an appendix or removing from the paper, especially if the space-to-benefit ratio is high.

### Specific common issues

There are a couple of issues which are specific to technical writing. Here are some major ones to consider.

#### Grammar and sentence structure

* Many writers think that long, complicated sentences are more sophisticated. In reality, they are harder to read. You can introduce more complex sentence structure later. For the early drafts, just stick to short and simple sentences.
* Passive voice. You will read a lot of technical writing that is written in passive voice. For example: "it was shown by Wang and Xie that A = B [1]." Passive voice is not always bad! But it's more direct and clear (often) to write an actice sentence: "Wang and Xie showed that A = B [1]."  


#### Minor notes

* If using "use" works where you wanted to write "utilize", then use "use" instead.
* "upto" should be "up to"
* It is tempting to add capitalization to things but is often not needed.  
BAD: "the algorithm is $\epsilon$-Differentially Private", "we will use  Complex Analysis to solve this problem."   
GOOD: "the algorithm is $\epsilon$-differentially private", "we will use complex analysis to solve this problem."
* Look up what a "comma splice" is and avoid making them.

#### Mathematical writing

* See [this handy guide](https://math.mit.edu/~poonen/papers/writing.pdf).
* "Consider that $X > 0$" should be "Assume that $X > 0$"
* When citing a specific mathematical result, put in the reference to the specific result. For example:  
`Using the Weierstrass Approximation` `Theorem~\cite[Lemma 3.2]{Rudin}`
* Make sure
 
#### Citations and bibliographies

* Don't use citations as nouns.    
BAD:  "In [1], it was shown that A = B."
GOOD:  "Shah et al. [1] showed that A = B."
* Don't start sentences with a citation.  
BAD: "[1] showed that A = B."  
GOOD: "Shah et al. [1] showed that A = B."
* Keep a clean and consistent bibliography
  * Make sure all authors are listed. Check to make sure you have all accents in names! That is part of spelling the name correctly.
  * Either abbreviate **all** journal/conference titles or write all of them out in full.
  * Check titles for proper nouns! Unless you write "{Gaussian}" or "{G}aussian", LaTeX will render the it as "gaussian." This also holds for acronyms, so "{PCA}" and "{fMRI}" not "PCA" and "fMRI". 
  * Don't use "Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on" but instead use "IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing"
  * Make sure you get page numbers if there are any: many publishers will ask you to put them in anyway so doing it ahead of time saves time later.
  * By default sure you include a URL in the BibTeX. They can be removed later if you need the space.

## LaTeX

LaTeX is supposed to format things for you -- don't use manual line breaks like `\\` in running text unless you absolutley have to. You can often specifiy hyphenations in the preamble if you need to let LaTeX break lines.

Don't worry about issues like page length and so on until the paper is written -- it's a waste of time to hack around with stuff like that until you are on final edits cleaning things up. So don't evern put in things like `\vspace{-1cm}` or things like that to save space.

### Common LaTeX Errors to avoid

Here are some general tips to start out:

* [JDO's common errors](https://web.ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/commonerrors.html)
* [Eddie Kohler's advice](https://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/latex.html)


### Mathematical writing

#### Notation and macros

Setting up good notation is hard! Sometimes you get halfway through writing something up and realize your notation is terrible and you have to switch all `x_i` to `z_i` for example. One thing that you can do to be more systematic and use macros to set notation for variables based on their meaning, so for example using `\newcommand{\loss}{\ell}` might save time if you decide to switch from using `\ell` for your loss function to using `f`.

Since LaTeX is used by so many different research communities, it's also helpful to define macros for your particular sub-area. For example, setting up a macro for Kullback-Leibler divergence can make equations a bit easier to read in the markup. The directory here has a set of basic macros which can be useful as a starting point, see `macros.tex`.

All things being equal, it's better to have an inset equation than an equation in running text.  It makes things a lot easier to read.

#### Miscellaneous tips and tricks

* Don't use the `equation` or `eqnarray` environments. Use `align` instead.  If it's an IEEE paper you can (should?) use `IEEEeqnarray`.  See the documentation for `IEEEeqnarray` if you like.

* Become familiar with the following environments which will save you a lot of anguish over using the `array` environment. 
	* `bmatrix`, `pmatrix`
	* `cases`

* Use auto-sizing delimiters like `\left[` and `\right]`. This statement might be slightly controversial but I stand by it. You want your equations to look nice and readable -- having parentheses that are too small makes things harder to understand.

* Remember to punctuate equations. Inline equations should be treated as if they are in running text.


### Making your LaTeX more readable

While using `Lyx` or `Overleaf` may make it seem like LaTeX can be done in a WYSIWYG manner, editing LaTeX is best done in the code, and you can do a lot to help yourself make the code more readable and hence easier to read/write.

#### Macros

Use macros to help you avoid pain when you (inevitably) discover there is a better notation for the problem you are trying to describe.  Examples of useful general macros that I use:

```
\def\mbf{\mathbf}
\def\mc{\mathcal}
\def\msf{\mathsf}
\newcommand{\norm}[1]{\left| #1 \right|}
\newcommand{\ip}[2]{\left\langle #1, #2 \right\rangle}
\newcommand{\diag}{\mathop{\mathrm{diag}}\nolimits}
\def\defeq{ \stackrel{\Delta}{=} }
\newcommand{\field}[1]{\mathbb{#1}}
\newcommand{\R}{\field{R}}
\newcommand{\argmax}{\mathop{\mathrm{argmax}}}
```

Using macros will save you a ton of time and also will make your LaTeX easier to read.  

#### Whitespace and pretty printing

LaTeX is insensitive to a lot of whitespace, so you can make your code easier to read/write/edit if you try to format it.  Therefore something like:

```
So we can see $$C(x,y)= \begin{cases} 
x^2 y & x < y \\ x^3 y^2 & x \ge y 
\end{cases}$$ yields the optmal tradeoff.
```

Is better as

```
So we can see
  \begin{align}
  C(x,y)= 
  	   \begin{cases}
	   x^2 y      &      x < y \\ 
	   x^3 y^2      &      x \ge y 
	   \end{cases}
  \end{align}
```
  
These two will look the same, but the latter is easier to read and edit. This is a matter of taste, but if you are writing with other people (e.g. your advisor) it helps to make the code easier to read.


### References and citations

* BibTeX and citation best practices
	* Use BibDesk (Mac) or JabRef (Windows) or a related tool
	* Possibly think of switching to BibLaTeX (may not be good for IEEE though)

* When referring to theorems, sections, etc, capitalize them.   
BAD: "we use theorem \ref{thm:upperbound} from section \ref{sec:bounds}"   
GOOD: "we use Theorem \ref{thm:upperbound} from Section \ref{sec:bounds}" 
	
#### Internal references

Use `\label` and `\ref` for internal references -- don't use static equation numbers. Use `\eqref{foo}` instead of `(\ref{foo})`.


## The Thesis

The thesis/dissertation is what you produce at the end of your Ph.D. as public proof that you have advanced human knowledge in some area through the work you have done in the last few years. It also is evidence that 
you have become an expert in an area of study. 

Some fields/advisors believe that it is ok to have a "staple thesis": just staple three papers together and turn it in. Sometimes this is literal -- an economics thesis I saw from MIT even restarted page numbers with each chapter and had separate bibliographies per chapter. However, a more conventional approach is to treat the thesis as a *synthesis* and *more fully explained* version of your research work. Not every paper of yours has to be crammed into the thesis.

Think of the thesis as being read by a student with a Masters who wants to work in this area. Your thesis should give them a good sense of:

* *What is the general state of known results and how did this area come about?* You want to both address the history of the field/problem and the specific recent advances to properly contextualize your own contribution. This is a more comprehensive and deeper literature review than you can plausibly fit into a paper. A good literature review is itself a research contribution: the student who reads your thesis next will really get a good sense of the field.

### Advice when it comes time to write

**NEEDS TO BE WRITTTEN**

#### Common thesis mistakes

* Check everywhere that you have "chapter" instead of "paper". For example, "in this paper we show..." should become "in this chapter we show..."
* Thesis pages are wider than journal/conference paper columns: you don't need to break equations weirdly to fit (as often). This is a danger when you cut-and-paste from the journal/conference paper.
