## Formulating problems

A really important habit to get into is writing things up as you go along. These are halfway between notes for yourself and a paper for public consumption. Once you have some small thing proved, taking the time to write it up as cleanly and clearly as you can for as broad an audience as you can manage is a good exercise -- you may decide to take out some of the explanations later when making an actual paper but cutting is easier than adding things in trying to remember what you were thinking.

Remember: you might be writing for yourself/your advisor now, but if you will be writing for a different audience later, you might want to start writing that way to make your life easier later. 

Get used to writing notes and other mini writeups in LaTeX. This will both help you get more proficient with LaTeX but also the act of writing down can help in trying to understand things. For example, suppose you want to use a theorem from some paper or book. Copy out the theorem and try to understand each piece as you write it out.


### Writing a problem statement

One of the most important (and often under-practiced) parts of research is writing a clear problem statement. Just writing down a clear and precise description of the setup and the problem to solve can make a huge improvement in your clarity of thinking.
