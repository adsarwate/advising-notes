## Research Inputs

It's important to gain both breadth and depth in grad school. You do this by:

* Going to a wide variety of talks and/or watching talks online.
* Reading a wide variety of papers.
* Reading non-papers (books, blogs, etc.) which are also technical.
* Reading the code of implementations instead of just running it.

A common excuse to not read a paper or not go to a talk is "it's not related to my research." If you find yourself asking that question, ask these questions instead:

* Am I such an expert in my research area that I can tell what is going to be useful and what is not going to be useful for my research?
* If I talk to someone on a job interview and it turns out I only know about the specific thing that I did research on myself, will that impress them?
* Would I call myself fluent in a language if I can only talk about the weather?



### Sign up for seminars and mailing lists

You should plan to go to lots of talks! At first, the talks will be confusing because you don't know as much about research and differet areas. But later on you will start to understand more and more. 

There are many benefits of going to talks on topics that are not **only about your research**:

* Being aware of what other work is out there is part of general scientific literacy: if you go to an interview and have only learned about some tiny narrow thing, the interviewer will think that you are too specialized and can't learn new things.
* The greatest asset to a researcher is curiosity. If something about a talk sounds interesting, then go to it! You will always learn something and any day you learn something new is a good day.
* Ideas from other fields can help you with your problem: maybe there are connections you didn't know existed, or a whole area of research which is interesting and related to what you are working on.
