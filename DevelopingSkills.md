## Growing over time

### Growing your mentoring team

It's very common for students to only have discussions about their career (research, future plans, etc.) with their peers and their advisor. Worse, there are some cases where student just stick to their lab and lab group. This is a mistake! Ideally you should have a network of mentors or people you turn to advice from. These can be your advisor and your peers but people inside and outside the university as well. Some people will be good for some kinds of advice and not so good for others. 

This is true even if you focus on research: your advisor may know a lot about topic A but not about topic B that you also need to learn about. Just go find the professor who knows about B and ask them.

In general, it's good to make early connections with other professors at the university. It's tempting to interact with other faculty in classes at the start of grad school and then again when you are putting together your thesis committee. After all, they are not your advisor. But this misses the point of having a thesis committee in the first place, which is to get ongoing advice about your research (probably not as frequently as your main advisor). 

You can find out what people are working on from their websites or Google Scholar pages. People you may want advice from could be inside or outside the department. By the time you take your qualifying exam you should already have a list of people who you think would make good committee members. It's better to have feedback from faculty whose expertise is relevant, even if you haven't had a class with them. 


### Checkpoints in grad school

There are a few checkpoints in grad school where you get feedback on your progress.

* The qualifying exam is the point where you demonstrate that you are prepared to do original research in your chosen area. Here are some thoughts on what a [rubric for the qualifying exam](QualRubric.md) might look like.
* **proposal defense -- to be written**
* **defense -- to be written**


### Making progress by using an IDP

While the program provides these checkpoints it's better to track your own progress so that you can identify your strengths and places where you need to learn more.

An *individual development plan* (IDP) is a good way to develop personalized checkpoints for yourself in terms how how you are building the skill you need to succeed in school and beyond. A PhD takes a long time and it's easy to get lost in the weeds. The worst thing is to look up one day and realize you have to graduate in 6 months and you don't really know what you want to do for a job afterwards.

The IDP is a structured process for navigating your way and it's not just for grad school! A long description of the idea is in a [report by the NRC](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML0904/ML090490452.pdf). There's a [generic worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bzYmQSWiivKy5RY7eUf4_yB86zSX6eT4ME5M0MYK75A/edit) and [more detailed form](https://daily-mustard-bca.notion.site/436a9cdc332441e6995ae190ffe3dbfb?v=4f5480713b384e7ab1fab86f13cf0d70&p=52a289e00c464af18fd2599b46279067&pm=s) to get the general idea of how these work. To get a feel for the idea and how it might work in an engineering department you can see a [worksheet from Purdue](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/Academics/Graduate/ProfessionalDevelopment/IDP).

Some schools (like [Rutgers](https://grad.rutgers.edu/academics/individual-development-plans) and funding agencies (like NIH) require IDPs for graduats students. Other schools have tools which you can look at:

* [UC Berkeley](https://grad.berkeley.edu/idp/)
* [University of Wisconsin](https://grad.wisc.edu/professional-development/individual-development-plan/)

Web-based tools that you can use include

* [The "official" Rutgers tool](https://sgs-studentidp.rutgers.edu/)
* [A tool from AAAS](https://myidp.sciencecareers.org/)
